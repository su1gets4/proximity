Proximity is a reinforcement learning project seeking to push what can be done with AI in Trackmania as far as possible. 

## Trackmania

Trackmania is a racing game that sacrifices some of the realism of sim-racers for a wide variety of track types with all kinds of tricks like wall riding, stunt jumps and wallbangs. Furthermore, Trackmania was designed for equality of input devices which means that keyboard inputs are a viable way to play and therefore that discrete input algorithms like DQN can be applied. In other words, Trackmania is a deep game which can serve as a benchmark to work on any RL algorithm.

## Environment

Proximity uses the environment architecture of linesight RL
